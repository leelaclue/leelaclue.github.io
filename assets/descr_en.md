### Clarity begins in stillness — LeelaClue supports mindful reflection.

In everyday life, it’s easy to lose perspective when thoughts circle or emotions feel blocked.
**LeelaClue** is a calm digital space for self-reflection and mindfulness. The app uses the symbolic imagery of the ancient game of Leela to invite new perspectives and deepen personal awareness.

#### Your personal reflection ritual:
LeelaClue is designed as an inspirational tool for inner contemplation.

*   **Find your focus**
    Formulate a question or intention that currently occupies your thoughts.

*   **The 3-card reflection**
    Draw three cards intuitively, each offering a different perspective:
    *   **Status** – How do I experience my current situation?
    *   **Influence** – Which patterns or influences may be present?
    *   **Resource** – Which supportive attitude or possibility could be helpful?

The cards provide symbolic impulses that encourage reflection — without fixed answers or predictions.

#### What makes LeelaClue unique

*   **Holistic perspectives**
    Instead of keywords, you receive calm, thoughtful texts that invite interpretation and personal insight.
*   **Minimal, modern design**
    No kitsch, no effects. A clear, soothing aesthetic that supports focus and presence.
*   **Your personal journal**
    Past reflections are saved automatically, allowing you to revisit or delete them at any time.
*   **Mindful usage**
    One reflection per day encourages conscious engagement and space for integration.

#### Who is this app for?
For people who value mindfulness, journaling, or moments of calm in a busy world.
LeelaClue helps you organize thoughts and experience your own inner perception more consciously.
