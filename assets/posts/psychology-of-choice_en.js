<p>Our lives are essentially an endless chain of decisions. From the moment we wake up to the moment we sleep, we are choosing paths.</p>

<p>Some of these decisions are simple. They are mathematical. You can open a spreadsheet, list the pros and cons, and assign values.</p>

<ul>
<li>Option A: You lose your leg.</li>
<li>Option B: You keep your leg and earn $5,000.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whatever your evaluation method, the choice is obvious. When the variables are clear and the outcome is predictable, logic is your best friend.</p>

<h4>The Problem of the "Unknown"</h4>
<p>But then there are the other decisions. The difficult ones. The ones that keep you awake at 3:00 AM.</p>

<p>These decisions are hard not because you aren’t smart enough to analyze them, but because you don’t have enough information. You cannot know if quitting your job will lead to happiness or ruin. You cannot calculate if moving to a new city will make you lonely or free.</p>

<p>In these moments, logic fails us. The spreadsheet is empty. It feels like you might as well flip a coin.</p>

<h4>The Coin Flip Revelation</h4>
<p>There is a famous psychological trick regarding coin flips. If you are torn between two choices, you toss a coin. Heads for Option A, Tails for Option B.</p>

<p>But the trick isn’t about how the coin lands.</p>

<p>The magic happens while the coin is in the air, or the split second you see the result. If the coin lands on "Heads" and your stomach drops with disappointment, you suddenly realize something profound: You wanted it to be Tails.</p>

<p>In situations where data is missing, the goal isn't to make the "objectively right" decision (because that doesn't exist yet). The goal is to find the decision whose consequences you can accept.</p>

<p>Deep down, your intuition has usually already calculated which risk you are willing to take. You already know which option you can live with.</p>

<h4>Why You Can't Trick Yourself</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, you can't live your life relying on coin flips. The human brain is clever; it knows when you are playing a game. If you try to flip a coin "just to see how you feel," the trick often fails because the stakes aren't real. You can't force that moment of revelation.</p>

<p>You need a mirror, not a coin.</p>

<h4>How LeelaClue Works</h4>
<p>This is where LeelaClue comes in.</p>

<p>LeelaClue is not an oracle. It doesn't predict the future, and it doesn't tell you what to do. Instead, it acts as that moment the coin is in the air—but in a sustainable, mindful way.</p>

<p>When you bring a question to LeelaClue, it presents you with a spread of metaphorical cards—Status, Obstacle, and Resource. But more importantly, it gives you deep, reflective questions and texts.</p>

<p>These texts act as a resonance chamber. When you read a specific phrase or answer a journaling prompt, you will feel that same internal pull you feel during a coin flip. You might read a card about "patience" and feel resistance—that resistance tells you that you are actually eager to act now. You might read a card about "letting go" and feel relief—that relief is your answer.</p>

<p>The knowledge of which path is right for you is already hidden inside you. LeelaClue simply provides the framework to quiet the noise, bypass the panic of the "unknown," and reveal the choice you have, in your heart, already made.</p>

<p><strong>Stop guessing. Pause. Reflect. The answer is already there.</strong></p>
