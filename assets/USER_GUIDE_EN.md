-   **Hold Button**: The central button used to focus and start the spread.
-   **Help Icon (Left)**: Access instructions and app info.
-   **Diary Button (Right)**: A button with a book icon to view your past spreads.

### Performing a Spread
1.  **Formulate a Question**: Type a question or intention into the text box. It must be at least **5 words** long to encourage specific and thoughtful inquiry.
    *   *Tip: Avoid simple Yes/No questions. Ask "What..." or "How..."*
2.  **Focus & Hold**: Press and **hold** the central button.
    *   A breathing circle will appear.
    *   Inhale and exhale in sync with the circle to calm your mind.

3.  **Reveal Your Cards**: Once the focus is complete, 3 cards will appear face down.
    *   Tap each card to reveal it.
    *   The app will guide you through the reveal animation.

After revealing all 3 cards, you will see the **Result Screen**. The cards correspond to three perspectives:
1.  **Where am I?**: Your current state or the core of the issue.
2.  **What I don't notice**: Hidden influences or subconscious factors.
3.  **What will help**: Guidance, resources, or actions to take.
