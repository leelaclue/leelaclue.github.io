            **Effective Date:** December 11, 2025

            This Privacy Policy informs you about the processing of personal data in connection with the LeelaClue
            mobile application. The protection of your personal data is important to the developer. Below you will find
            all relevant information about data collection, processing, and your rights.

            ## Responsible Party
            **Responsible:** Irene Engelko
            **Address:** Bad Schönborn, Germany
            **Email:** [leelaclue@gmail.com](mailto:leelaclue@gmail.com)

            ## Brief Description of the App
            LeelaClue is an entertainment app that makes the knowledge of the Leela map accessible. "The 72 fields of
            the Leela map are the keys to the states of your consciousness. But the map itself is often too complex.
            LeelaClue distills this ancient knowledge and transforms each state into a clear, intuitive message for your
            here and now."

            ## What Data is Collected?
            **None.** The app does not collect, gather, store, or transmit any personal data from users. In particular,
            no names, email addresses, usage data, location data, contacts, photos, audio recordings, or other personal
            information is transmitted to the developer or third parties.

            ## Permissions and Access
            The app does not require any special system permissions (e.g., camera, microphone, location, or contacts).
            Should a permission be required in a future version, this will be clearly communicated in the app and in
            this Privacy Policy.

            ## Third Parties and Third-Party Services
            Currently, LeelaClue does not use any third-party SDKs, analytics tools, advertising networks, crash
            reporting services, or cloud services that collect or transmit user data. Should this change in the future,
            the Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly and users will be informed.

            ## Storage and Transmission
            Since no data is collected, there is also no storage on remote servers and no transmission to third parties.

            ## Children
            The app is not intended for children under 13 years of age. No personal data from children is collected.
            Parents and guardians who have concerns may contact the developer at the email address above.

            ## Rights of Data Subjects
            Because LeelaClue does not process personal data, there are currently no circumstances that would require a
            request for information or deletion under Articles 15-17 GDPR. Should data processing change in the future,
            the statutory rights of data subjects apply (information, correction, deletion, restriction of processing,
            data portability, and objection). Please direct inquiries by email to
            [leelaclue@gmail.com](mailto:leelaclue@gmail.com).

            ## Changes to this Privacy Policy
            Changes or additions to this Privacy Policy will be published here. It is recommended to review the policy
            regularly. In case of significant changes, users will be informed in the app or via update notice.

            ## Note for Google Play Store – Data Safety
            The following information is relevant for the Google Play "Data Safety" form. Please use this summary when
            filling out the Play Console form:
