            **1. Purpose of the Application**
            The LeelaClue application is intended solely for entertainment, reflection, and inspirational purposes.
            All generated materials, card spreads, texts, and images are created automatically using algorithmic
            principles of randomness and/or artificial intelligence. They do not constitute scientifically grounded
            statements, predictions, or facts.

            **2. Not Professional Advice or Diagnosis**
            The materials provided by the application do not replace professional advice or treatment.
            In particular:

            * **Not Medical or Psychological Advice:** The application does not provide diagnoses, medical treatment, or
            therapeutic services. If you have health problems or psychological disorders, please consult qualified
            medical professionals.
            * **Not Legal or Financial Advice:** The application does not give legally binding or financially
            significant recommendations. Do not make legal or financial decisions solely based on the content of the
            application.

            **3. AI Notice (Transparency Obligation under EU Law)**
            Part of the content of this application is created by a generative AI system. The output may be erroneous,
            incomplete, or inappropriate. Consequently, it should not be used as a reliable basis for decision-making.

            **4. User Responsibility**
            The interpretation of all content and the use of the application are at your own responsibility.
            The developer is not liable for actions, decisions, or conclusions made by users based on the generated
            content.

            **5. Limitation of Liability**
            To the extent permitted by law, liability for damages arising from the use or non-use of the application is
            excluded. This includes in particular:

            * indirect damages
            * consequential damages
            * lost profits
            * property damage
            * damages due to technical failures, data loss, or limited availability

            No guarantee is provided for the accuracy, completeness, currency, or availability of the generated content.

            **6. Legally Non-Excludable Liability**
            Liability for damages to life, body, or health, as well as damages arising from intent or gross negligence,

            **7. No Guarantee of Availability or Absence of Technical Errors**
